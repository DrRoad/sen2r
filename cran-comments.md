## CRAN review
> The auto-check found additional issues for the *last* version released on CRAN:
  M1mac <https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/M1mac/sen2r.out>
CRAN incoming checks do not test for these additional issues and you will need
an appropriately instrumented build of R to reproduce these.
Hence please reply-all and explain: Have these been fixed?

All the errors found in M1mac were fixed (see the NEWS.md file for details).
